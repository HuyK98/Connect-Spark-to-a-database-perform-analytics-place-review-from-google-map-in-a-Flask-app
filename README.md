Apache Spark is an open source distributed processing system used for big data workloads. The system uses in-memory write caching and optimized query execution to help queries quickly parse data of any size. Apache Spark provides development APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R and supports code reuse across a variety of workloads, such as batch processing, interactive queries, and real-time analytics. real-time, machine learning and graph processing. You'll find this system used by organizations in every industry, including at FINRA, Yelp, Zillow, DataXu, Urban Institute, and CrowdStrike.
Use Apache Spark to analyze and predict google maps reviews.

Build demo using the Flask-app to visualize analyzed reviews, use Spark to analyze and make evaluation predictions.
After this project, things i have learnt: 
I understood and leveraged the power of Apache Spark to analyze large amounts of data
I learned and used the Work Bootstrap frame in combination with Flask to make a complete interface that showed the predicted results
Deploy the model on VS Code, use flask to visualize the model
